# SQL, MORE QUERIES.

### Introduction.
* SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
* SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.
* It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. 
* SQL offers two main advantages over older readâ€“write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. 
* Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. 
* Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
