# JAVASCRIPT - WEB SCRAPING.

### Description.

  * Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet.
   * This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed.
   * If youve ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.
   * Many Internet Web sites contain JavaScript, a scripting programming language that runs on the web browser to make specific features on the web page functional.
   * If JavaScript has been disabled within your browser, the content or the functionality of the web page can be limited or unavailable.
